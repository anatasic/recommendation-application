## Recommendation application for video games on PC, built in Clojure. 

Tehnique used in this application is called collaborative filtering.
Advantage of this technique is that the system does not rely on the values for the feature variables of its items,
and consequently such a system does not need to know about the characteristics of
the items that are provided by it.

One note: in application are included *all* types of games that are implemented for playing on PC.

If, in any case, you receive a "Slow down, 429 Too Many Requests" error, just refresh the page again. This is because Metacritics have some kind of restricting policy related to crawling pages. 

## Literature

[Practical Clojure](http://www.amazon.com/Practical-Clojure-Experts-Voice-Source-ebook/dp/B003VM7G3S)

This is the first book I have read about a Clojure. It is a good introductory book, and can give you good insight about functional programming, as well as basic Clojure functions and some features. Here you can learn how to set up Clojure environment for some basic real-world task. 

[Programming Clojure, Second Edition](http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Clojure-Stuart-Halloway/dp/1934356867)

Second edition of this book presents some changes in Clojure, since it was first introduced in 2007.It has some good explanation about protocols, multimethods, and there is a whole chapter about Clojure's connection to Java.

[Clojure Programming](http://www.amazon.com/Clojure-Programming-Chas-Emerick/dp/1449394701/ref=pd_sim_b_1?ie=UTF8&refRID=0KCSHHVCSA3Z3YCX6JAF)

Clojure programming is definetely the most comprehensive book about a toopic. As Practical Clojure and Programming Clojure it contains explanation about functional laguages in general, as well as explanations of Clojure functions and other features, but it goes much deeper into the Core of the languge, explaining all pros of working in CLojure. Although it is a excellent reference, I would strongly recommend to first read the two first books (and maybe [The Joy of Clojure](http://www.amazon.com/The-Joy-Clojure-Thinking-Way/dp/1935182641/ref=pd_sim_b_2?ie=UTF8&refRID=0KCSHHVCSA3Z3YCX6JAF)) before you start reading this book.   

[Web Development with CLojure](http://www.amazon.com/Web-Development-Clojure-Build-Bulletproof/dp/1937785645/ref=pd_sim_b_3?ie=UTF8&refRID=0KCSHHVCSA3Z3YCX6JAF)

As its title says, this book is about developing a web applications using Clojure. It is written in a good, easy to understand manner, and for me it has excellent informations about vastly of available libraries, tools and good practices out there, that can be used in bulding your application. This is definetely a must-read book about web development in CLojure, and I have used it a lot during bulding my application.
